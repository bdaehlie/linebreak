<p><b>Choosing A Line Break Type</b></p>
<p>You can choose which type of line break type you are converting to by using the pulldown menu on LineBreak's main window.
You can also choose to select the line break type you want to convert to at the time of dropping files onto LineBreak.
Selecting a line break type at the time of drag-drop will not change your main selection.
It will only affect that batch. If you turn this feature off (in LineBreak's main window,)
then dropping files onto LineBreak will convert them to whatever is set in the main window.</p>

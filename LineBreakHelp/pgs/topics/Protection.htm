<p><b>Setting Protection</b></p>
<p>
There is no way for LineBreak to determine if a file is text or not.
This is not due to LineBreak, it is just not possible to be sure one way or another.
To prevent the corruption of non-text files such as pictures and Microsoft&reg; Word documents,
you may set up protection.
</p>
<p>
You can tell LineBreak to ignore files with certain extensions,
or only convert files with certain extensions.
You can set up protection by turning it on (in the main window) and then clicking the "Set Protection" button.
This feature is especially useful for processing folders.
For example, you could drop a folder containing an entire website onto LineBreak and set up the rules so
that images or anything else that is not text does not get corrupted.

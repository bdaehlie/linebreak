<p><b>Handling Folders</b></p>
<p>
LineBreak has the option to turn folder handling off because it is easy to make big mistakes when handling
folders. If folder handling is off, LineBreak will ignore any folders you tell it to convert.
</p>
<p>
When folder handling is on, you may choose whether to treat folders recursively or not. If recursive folder handling
is not on, LineBreak will only convert the files in the folder you told it to convert, ignoring subfolders. If recursive folder
handling is on, LineBreak will handle all subfolders and their subfolders (to the deepest level possible,) converting everything
on the file system tree under the folder you told it to convert.
</p>
<p>
Keep in mind that no matter how you tell LineBreak to convert a file, it will not get converted if <a href="Protection.htm">protection settings</a> do not allow it.

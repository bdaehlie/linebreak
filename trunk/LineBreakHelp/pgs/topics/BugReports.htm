<p><b>Send Bug Reports!</b></p>
<p>Send any bug reports to "josh.aas@gmail.com". You should find me quite responsive.
Make sure you have read the "Read Me First" document included with LineBreak before you submit bug reports.
I need to know exactly how to reproduce the problem. Give me as many details as possible.
Better that I not have to go back and ask for them.</p>
